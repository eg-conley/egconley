                <p>I am currently a junior studying Computer Engineering at Boston University. 
                My fascination with the world-transforming ability of technology, especially as it intersects with art, 
                began at a young age playing with handheld gaming consoles like my LeapFrog or Gameboy, and later with 
                web games. This manifests in my gravitation towards game development and a drive to absorb new information 
                in order to excel in my fields. I aim to contribute to streamlined, immersive experiences and digital connectivity 
                with software, hardware, and everything in between.</p>
                <p>Born in Shaoyang, China but raised in the Chicago suburbs, I had a unique upbringing as an adoptee and have developed 
                a passion for sharing my experiences and inspiring connections through niche similarities. Other interests include staying 
                active, which often includes going to the gym, playing soccer, and (recently) getting back into skiing. As mentioned, I cherish 
                the impact of art around me and can often be found with headphones on listening to my favorite artists on repeat or frequenting
                art museums. Some long term goals include moving back to Chicago, Illinois to work in the city. Nothing beats the lively, 
                invigorating environment of a place so close to the beautiful Lake Michigan. Later down the road, I would love to pursue 
                an MBA and continue my education.
